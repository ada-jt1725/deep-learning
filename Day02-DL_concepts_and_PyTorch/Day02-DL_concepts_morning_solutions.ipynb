2.2 Loss functions\n","\n","Training a network is an optimisation procedure, and therefore it relies on being able to quantify somehow the performance of models (networks in DL). To do so, we define a quantity that distills the performance of the model to a single number, called the objective function. In deep learning, we often use a measure of 'error' for this, and we try to minimise it, hence the name loss function. This quantity has other names, most of them summarised in the following definition from the Deep Learning book (Goodfellow et al, 2016):\n","\n",">*The function we want to minimize or maximize is called the objective function or criterion. When we are minimizing it, we may also call it the cost function, loss function, or error function.*\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The two most common loss functions are:\n","\n","- Mean squared error (MSE):  \n","\n","$$ L_{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i^N ( y_i - h_i(x) )^2$$\n","\n","where $h_i(x)$ is an element of the output of the network, $y_i$ and element of what we define as the target, and $N$ is the total number of elements for this data sample. For example, $h_i(x)$ and $y_i$ could be pixels in an image, and $N$ the total number of pixels in this image.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","- Cross entropy(CE):\n","\n","$$ L_{CE} = \\sum_j^M y_j \\log(h_j(x)) $$\n","\n","where $h_j(x)$ is the probability (calculated using softmax) of the sample to belong to class $j$, $y_j$ is the real probability of the sample belonging to this class (either 1 or 0), and $M$ is the total number of classes we are using in the classification. For example, in the network we implemented on the first day, we had 10 classes (digits 0-9), and every time we ran a sample (image of a handwritten digit) through our network, we had an output vector with 10 values corresponding to the probability of the sample to belong to each class.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","It is trivial to see that if we only have two classes, we can use the binary cross entropy, which only requires the true probability to belong to one of the classes:\n","\n","$$L_{BCE} = -y \\log(h(x)) - (1 - y)\\log(1-h(x))$$\n","\n","which looks like:\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hvjfP5zmRIu-0mAbANx-mR856BDtil1S\" width=\"400\"/></center>\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The loss in binary classification tasks, then, has this form:\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1C56ycxV56Sclu9Zpf6O7tjN2hje5W_Sj\" width=\"400\"/></center>\n","\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### **Clarifications and links to activations for the cross-entropy loss:**\n","\n","The last layer of a binary classifier that uses a BCE loss is equivalent to logistic regression:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AtQhgLLuGKiLi8neVLNo1xQ91rfW7XLj\" width=\"800\"/></center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","where the activation of the last layer is a sigmoid function:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J3lm-Gm7x1FCRlORtGeAFoBjLwl4zxNB\" width=\"600\"/></center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","which also defines the decision boundary:\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Tas4jQySJY0HRS7sxiCS2czOiOv4f95o\" width=\"700\"/></center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Do you remember https://playground.tensorflow.org/?

Some people interpret it as a means to reduce the internal covariate shift (see [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) for details), but more recent developments seem to point that it acts as a regulariser that smooths the objective function (and therefore make it better suited to gradient descent minimisation methods).\n","\n","***internal covariate shift***: *changes in the distribution of data as it navigates through the layers of the networks.*\n","\n","In summary, batch normalisation:\n","\n","- Normalises (standardises) values at each layer of the network, instead of just on input layer.\n","- Accelerates training by stabilizing the layer changes through the iterations.\n","- Provides some regularization, like dropout, but not as strong (open topic of discussion).\n","- Batch normalisation should really be called batch standardization.\n","It reduces the probability that vanishing or exploding gradients occur.\n","\n","[A good video by Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNIpEZLv_eg) on this topic\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","<br>\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MMBI_ljFKpCi"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"MM_HrTOSs8C3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
